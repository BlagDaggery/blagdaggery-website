			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hi, my name is Blaine, and I have no idea what I'm doing.</p>
			<p>Blagdaggery, or Blag for short, started as a random nickname one of my college roommates assigned to me. It has since taken on a greater meaning.</p>
			<p>An English guy once told me that blagging is when someone doens't know anything, but makes it up as he or she goes. After hearing that definition, the name Blagdaggery took on a whole new meaning in my head.</p>
			<p>In life, I continually find that I (and everyone else for that matter) has no clue what they are doing. So we're all just making it up one day at a time.</p>
			<p>In my head, "BlagDaggery" is the grand total of all times where you had no idea what to do, but just went for it, and lived to tell your friends all about it at the bar.</p>
			<p>This is BlagDaggery. I don't know what I'm doing. But I enjoy learning. And I enjoy the adventure of figuring things out.</p>
