// Blaine -- this is a lesson in 1) CSS preprocessing (go read about it), and 2) file organization
// Instead of authoring straight-up CSS, you should really use a CSS preprocessor, such as SCSS (Sass)
// You can read about it here: http://sass-lang.com/guide
// 
// 
// This file would be "compiled" into style.css.

// Luan -- Very cool! I've been learning about SCSS, and it makes a lot of sense. I'll start using it.
// Do you have any recommendations on what application to download so I can start using SCSS?
// I'm looking at Koala and Scout.
// Update: I just downloaded Koala
